    <h3>Who have I coached?</h3>

    <p class="article_content">
        Today, I realized I don't have a record of many teams that I've coached. From one-time review sessions from 3 years ago, to teams I even coached weekly for a couple months, many of their memories have slipped through my fingers like the sands of time. 
    </p>
    <p class="article_content">
        Part of me wants to feel remorse, quickly scrounge up a hundredth list to track which teams I coached and for how long.
    </p>
    <p class="article_content">
        But is that the memory I want to hold onto? Even with a list, I will lose track of each individual over time, as they meld into each other like The Stranger in Slay the Princess. I will forget the late night conversations about how to deal with hardship, conquer directionlessness, and lead each other to improve at a skill. I will forget which people have thanked me, told me I've improved their mindset or even saved their lives. List or not, many of these memories will be lost, and all of them will blur.
    </p>
    <p class="article_content">
        But the remembering is not the important part. It's the doing.
    </p>
    <p class="article_content">
        The process of coaching is extremely rewarding for me, and it has been for years. Even though I find it difficult to make time to consistently coach, when I coach I feel enabled in leading a new group of friends forward. There are problems that I can help people solve, and help THEM to feel empowered to solve even when I'm not there. I'm not managing them - I'm facilitating their growth and learning. I've given them the tools to learn on their own, and I hope that they are continuing with the mental seeds I planted in discussing how to grow. Over time, they can make themselves better, and then make their part of the online world better.
    </p>
    <p class="article_content">
        It's strange -- to know you have made positive change while being gone. It's common - many poets are remembered posthumously, and scientific discoveries can take decades before they create policy changes. But the important thing is to keep doing good work because it is good: because it allows you to self-actualize, while making the world better. Even if you're not there to see it.
